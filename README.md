# Miscellaneous PDB tools

Some changes to [pdb-tools](https://github.com/haddocking/pdb-tools/), a handy
collection of Python scripts to manipulate `.pdb` files.

- **mergepdb.sh** - merges split files for protein and ligand, maintaining `CONECT` record.

## Licensing

Source scripts are in `/pdb-tools` (gitignored, see official repo). Modified scripts are in the project root
folder.
